# TextDetectorAndTranslator
This is an android project I created with Android Studio and Firebase

I have created this project for my College homework. I used Firebase's Text Detector and Translator utilities to have an application that can read pictures and translate them into the desired language.
//Firebase ve Android Studio kullanarak hazırladığım fotoğraflardan metin okuyabilen ve onu çeviriye dahip edip başka dile çevirebilen bir program.

## About
When I was deciding about my semester homework for my Web Programming course I have noticed the lackness of projects that uses both of those Firebase utilites, on the internet. There was lots of projects that used text recognition and translation but not both. So I combined those 2 with Intent and shared readen string with translation activity. All coded and prepared by myself in Java.
